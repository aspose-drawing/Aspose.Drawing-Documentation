Whether you're creating a bitmap from scratch or loading one from an existing file, Aspose.Drawing for Java simplifies these common tasks, providing a seamless experience for bitmap creation and editing.

## **Create New Bitmap in Java**

Creating a new image from scratch is pretty straightforward with the Aspose.Drawing Java API. The ensuing Java code example demonstrates how to create a new bitmap and draw an Arc on it:

1. Create an instance of the Bitmap class.
2. Initialize an object of the Graphics class from this bitmap.
3. Define a Pen object with the desired parameters.
4. Utilize the DrawArc method of the Graphics class object to draw an Arc.

## **Load existing Image from File into Bitmap**

Loading an existing image from a file and saving it back to disk using the Java API can be accomplished, as presented in the following Java code sample:
