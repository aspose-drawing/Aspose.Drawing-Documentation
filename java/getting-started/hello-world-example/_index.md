## **Hello World Example**

This "Hello World" example demonstrates the drawing capabilities of the Aspose.Drawing for Java API through a basic vector graphics creation.

The Aspose.Drawing library for Java library is a comprehensive tool for image manipulation and vector drawing. It facilitates the creation of vector graphics primitives like lines, curves, and figures by defining sets of points on a coordinate system. Additionally, it allows the display of text in various fonts, sizes, and styles, and provides the capability to save drawing results in popular graphics file formats. The subsequent example illustrates the process of drawing an arc in Java through the following steps.

1. Create an object of `Bitmap` class.
1. Create an object of `Graphics` class from this bitmap.
1. Define a `Pen` object with desired parameters.
1. Use the `drawArc()` method of `Graphics` class object to Draw an Arc.
