This "Hello World" example introduces the drawing features of Aspose.Drawing for .NET API with a simple vector graphics drawing. 

Aspose.Drawing for .NET is a feature-rich image manipulation and vector drawing library that is used to draw vector graphics primitives such as lines, curves, and figures. These are specified by sets of points on a coordinate system, to display text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and styles, and to save drawing results in commonly used graphics file formats. This example shows how to draw an arc using C# with the following steps.
