## Prerequisites

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

Docker must be installed on your system. For information on how to install Docker on Windows or Mac, refer to the links in the "See Also" section.

## Hello World Application

In this example, you create a simple Hello World console application that draws an ellipse and saves it as an image. The application can then be built and run in Docker.

### Creating the Console Application

To create the Hello World program, follow the steps below:
1. Once Docker is installed, make sure that it uses Linux Containers (default). If necessary, select the Switch to Linux containers option from the Docker Desktops menu.
1. Since the application will be run on Linux, you may need to install additional fonts. You could prefer `ttf-mscorefonts-installer`.
1. When all required dependencies are added, write a simple program that creates an ellipse and saves it as an image:<br>

{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "3562c2fe053aae0bda46f32abae6062a" "Examples-JAVA-Docker-Drawing.java" >}}

The resulting PNG image is saved to the `TestOut` folder:

<style>
   .frame {
    border: 2px solid darkgray;
    padding: 5px;
    margin: 10px 0 5px 5px;
    background: #f0f0f0;
    align-items: center;
   }
   .marginauto {
    margin: 10px auto 20px;
    display: block;
   }
   .frame figcaption {
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
   }
</style>

<figure class="frame"><p>
    <img class="marginauto" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspose-drawing/Aspose.Drawing-for-Java/main/Examples/gradient.png" alt="Ellipse drawing with gradient fill" width="1000" height="800"/>
<figcaption>Ellipse with gradient fill drawing in Java</figcaption>
</p></figure>

{{% alert color="primary" %}}
Note that the "TestOut" folder is specified as an output folder for saving output documents. When running the application in Docker, a folder on the host machine will be mounted to this folder in the container. This will enable you to easily view the output generated by Aspose.Drawing in the Docker container.

### Configuring a Dockerfile

The next step is to create and configure the Dockerfile.

1. Create the Dockerfile and place it next to the solution file of your application. Keep this file name without extension (the default).
1. In the Dockerfile, specify:

{{< highlight plain >}}
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish "Aspose.Drawing.Docker.Sample.csproj" -c Release -o /app/out
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "out/Aspose.Drawing.Docker.Sample.jar"]
{{< /highlight >}}

The above is a simple Dockerfile, which contains the following instructions:

- The SDK image to be used. Here it is the Net 6 image. Docker will download it when the build is run. The version of SDK is specified as a tag.
- After, you may need to install Fonts because the SDK image contains very few fonts. Also, you can use local fonts copied to docker the image.
- The working directory is specified in the next line.
- The command to copy everything to the container, publish the application, and specify the entry point.

### Building and Running the Application in Docker

Now the application can be built and run in Docker. Open your favorite command prompt, change the directory to the folder with the application (the folder where the solution file and the Dockerfile are placed) and run the following command:

{{< highlight plain >}}
docker build -t dockerfile .
{{< /highlight >}}

The first time this command is executed it may take longer, since Docker needs to download the required images. Once the previous command is completed, run the following command:

{{< highlight plain >}}
docker run --mount type=bind,source=C:\Temp,target=/app/TestOut --rm dockerfile from Docker
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

Pay attention to the mount argument, because, as mentioned earlier, a folder on the host machine is mounted into the container's folder, to easily see the results of the application execution. Paths in Linux are case sensitive.
