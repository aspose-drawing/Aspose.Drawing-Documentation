## **Evaluation Version Limitations**

Customers can comprehensively test the Aspose.Drawing Java API before reaching a final decision to make a purchase. However, it's important to note that the API comes with certain evaluation limitations if used without a license. These limitations encompass:

- The number of drawing operations is limited to 100 and an exception will be thrown after that.
- A watermark is embedded in the output image when a user saves the image.

## **Apply License using File or Stream Object**

The license can be loaded from a file or stream object. The easiest way to set a license is to put the license file in the same folder as the Aspose.Drawing.jar file and specify the file name, without a path, as shown in the example below.

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

If you are using any other Aspose for Java library along with Aspose.Drawing for Java, please specify the namespace for a License like Aspose.Drawing.License for Aspose.Drawing package.

### **Loading a License from File**

The easiest way to apply for a license is to put the license file in the same folder as the Aspose.Drawing.jar file and specify just the file name without a path.

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

When you call the SetLicense method, the license name that you pass should be that of your license file. For example, if you change the license file name to "Aspose.Drawing.lic" pass that file name to the setLicense() method.

## **Metered License**

Aspose.Drawing allows developers to apply a metered key. It is a new licensing mechanism. The new licensing mechanism will be used along with the existing licensing method. Those customers who want to be billed based on the usage of the API features can use the metered licensing. For more details, please refer to [Metered Licensing FAQ](https://purchase.aspose.com/faqs/licensing/metered) section.

A new class Metered has been introduced to apply metered key. Following is the sample code demonstrating how to set metered public and private keys.
